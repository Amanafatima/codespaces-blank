          <h2>A tiny gift for You🌹❤ ❤️✨</h2>

       <p> I have tried to put my love for you into words a thousand times,
        but every word, every sentence feels too small, too fragile, too ordinary.
        Because you—you are the poetry my soul has been reciting forever,
        even before my lips knew how to whisper your name.
        
        I always say that i love your eyes,
        Do you know why? 
        cause even when your words were confused , even when you heart was confused 
        those eyes they were never confused about me.
        They hold galaxies I could lose myself in,
        a warmth that melts the coldest corners of my heart.
        When the world is too much, too loud, too unkind,
        your voice is the only thing that brings me home.
        
        There’s a quiet magic in the way you exist,
        how you make love feel like the safest place in the world
        
        With just one smile, you color my universe.
        
        If loving you is a language, then i am the most fluent.
        If love is a lifetime, then I pray to spend every breath, every heartbeat,
        just loving you.💖</p>

          <p>
            My eyes refused to watch you leave, but everything around me felt helpless, acceptance filled my eyes and dried my heart , even my tears refused to fall, I wish they did so I wouldn't have to see u leave. 
U r my favorite.
            If my eyes reflect you, it is because they have learned to see only you.)

I have traced your name in my mind a thousand times,
felt it linger on my lips like a prayer, like a promise.
The world may call love a simple thing,
but the way I love you is not simple.
It is vast, endless, unshaken by time, untouched by doubt.. 💕

I have loved you more than you can think off, loved you for so long it became a habit ,
if loving you meant that i loose myself then i would happily love you till my last breath.
Maybe god isnt letting me foregt you cause you could use some extra prayer in you life and god knows am the only one who prayes for you.

            you have done something to me , black magic ? hahha joking , but magic for sure , 
            I could spend eternity listening to the sound of your laughter,
            watching the way your eyes soften when you look at me,
            memorizing every little detail of you, every little habit, every little dream.
            Because loving you is not just something I do—it is who I am.
            It is the most natural thing in the world,
            like breathing, like the sea meeting the shore, ✨💖

            something about you is special, 
            or more like everyhing about you is so sspecial.
            nothing about you is ordinary , everything baout you makes me go mad, go crazy, standing next you i feel like i dont belong anywhere near you , you feel like soo forbidden.  🌟
            my safest place, and the best person I’ve ever known.
            You help me in ways you don’t even realize, No matter how hard things get, you can never give up—because you are the strongest, my strongest. I believe in you, I need you, and I’ll always stand by you. So stay strong, not just for yourself, but for me too.
            With you, I feel safe, like nothing in this world can break me. You are not just strong—you are the strongest, the kind of man who stands tall even in the hardest storms. No matter how tough life gets, you can never fall because I need you, I believe in you, and I see the fire in you that never dies.
             
STAY STRONG, BECAUSE THE WORLD MAY TRY, BUT IT CAN NEVER SHAKE A MAN LIKE YOU.

I love you with a love that does not waver, does not fade.
A love that is written in the stars, whispered by the wind,

            <p>I AM HELL DAMNN SURE THAT 
              I have LOVED you in a thousand ways, in a thousand lifetimes before this one.
  Perhaps in another time, I was the wind that brushed past your skin,
  the rain that kissed your face,
  the whisper of a song you heard in a dream but never remembered.
  But in this life, I am here, with hands aching to hold you,
  a heart overflowing with love too vast for words 💕
  
  I WILL ALWAYS BE HERE FOR YOU , EVEN IF YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE I WONT, I AINT GONNA GIVE UP ON MY SWEET BOY NEITHER IN THIS LIFE NOR IN THE NEXT ONES.
  How could peopel hurt my boy, my life, my world, they dont know how much loved you are, once they know they the whole world would be jealous of you . no amount of money could ever buy the love i have for you.
  anything for my KING.
  I don’t need forever.
  I don’t need promises or a life beside you.
  I just need one second—one moment—where I can see you,
  breathe you in, carve the sight of you into my soul
  so that even in death, I can carry you with me.

              Every time I see you, my heart breaks and heals at the same time.
  Because loving you is the most beautiful thing I have ever felt,
  and yet, it is also the most painful.
  To want something so deeply, so desperately,
  and know that I can never truly call it mine—
  it’s a kind of ache that never fades.
  
  Somewhere, in another life, maybe we don’t have to hide.
  Maybe my hands fit into yours without hesitation.
  Maybe I get to hold you without fear,
  love you without limits, say your name without trembling. 💖✨

            <h2> IF LOVING YOU IS A SIN THEN I BELONG TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL. ✨💖</h2>
            <p>
              How do I erase something that has been written
              into my very soul?
              
              The world may not understand us.
              They may call it a mistake, a sin, an impossibility.
              But I know the truth—this is the purest thing I have ever known.
              Because when I look into your eyes, I don’t see a mistake.
              I see home. I see every dream I was too afraid to dream.
              I see the only person who has ever made me feel truly alive
              I don’t know what cruel twist of fate brought you into my life only to make you someone I could never truly have. But if this is all we get—stolen moments, silent glances, unspoken words—I will take it. I will take whatever piece of you the world allows me to have, even if it’s never enough.
  What will we be called when the world gtes to know us ? idk a match made in heaven? or the most forbidden love in history ever?
  shouldn’t love you like this.
  I shouldn’t want you the way I do.
  But tell me—how do I stop?
  How do I turn away from the one my eyes cried for.

            <p> if you wanna leave me then teach me to live without you, without dying every second.
            What might have love be made up of? sacrifice? pain? blood? what is it ? what could it be that it hurts and heals at the same time?
            why are you not mine? have you ever doubted my love? That would definetly be a sin? loving you is all i know to do? 
            will you get tired of waiting for me? tired of this distance ? i would never , would you? plss dont cause i dont know what to do if u do , i am helpless
            it takes both to be in a relation but only takes one to end it. You are so deeply woven into me that I can’t even see myself anymore.
            even if it leaves me breathless and broken—
            I would still choose you.
            A thousand times over, I would still choose you.
            If the choices were between dying losing every last drop of blood in me,
            or getting to look at you for just a second,
            I wouldn’t think twice.
        
            I would always choose you.
            
            Because what is a life without you in it?
            What is a heartbeat if it doesn’t beat for you?
            What is survival if I have to live in a world where I can’t see you,
            can’t feel you, can’t love you—even from a distance?
            
            നീ ഇല്ലെങ്കിൽ, ഞാൻ ആരും അല്ല

            convincing myself that I can live without you,
            that I can settle for stolen moments and silent dreams.
            But the truth is—I can’t.
            I don’t want to live in a world where I have to love you in the shadows,
            where I have to swallow your name like a secret
            when all I want is to call you mine.
            I know the world is against us.
I know there are rules, expectations, obstacles.
I don’t need the world’s approval.
I don’t need promises of forever.
I just need you.
I need your hand in mine, your voice in my silence,
your love in the spaces between my heartbeats.

Let me fall, let me bleed, let me lose everything—
because in that single moment, where my eyes find yours,
I will have had everything I ever needed.

And that is enough.

So tell me—if I ask you, if I give you everything,
if I love you with a love that defies reason and time—
Will you be mine?
