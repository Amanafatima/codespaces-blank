       <p> I have tried to put my love for you into words a thousand times,
        but every word, every sentence feels too small, too fragile, too ordinary.
        Because you‚Äîyou are the poetry my soul has been reciting forever,
        even before my lips knew how to whisper your name.
        
        I always say that i love your eyes,
        Do you know why? 
        cause even when your words were confused , even when you heart was confused 
        those eyes they were never confused about me.
        They hold galaxies I could lose myself in,
        a warmth that melts the coldest corners of my heart.
        When the world is too much, too loud, too unkind,
        your voice is the only thing that brings me home.
        
        There‚Äôs a quiet magic in the way you exist,
        how you make love feel like the safest place in the world
        
        With just one smile, you color my universe.
        
        If loving you is a language, then i am the most fluent.
        If love is a lifetime, then I pray to spend every breath, every heartbeat,
        just loving you.üíñ</p>

            My eyes refused to watch you leave, but everything around me felt helpless, acceptance filled my eyes and dried my heart , even my tears refused to fall, I wish they did so I wouldn't have to see u leave. 
U r my favorite.
            If my eyes reflect you, it is because they have learned to see only you.)

I have traced your name in my mind a thousand times,
felt it linger on my lips like a prayer, like a promise.
The world may call love a simple thing,
but the way I love you is not simple.
It is vast, endless, unshaken by time, untouched by doubt.. üíï

I have loved you more than you can think off, loved you for so long it became a habit ,
if loving you meant that i loose myself then i would happily love you till my last breath.
Maybe god isnt letting me foregt you cause you could use some extra prayer in you life and god knows am the only one who prayes for you.

            I could spend eternity listening to the sound of your laughter,
            watching the way your eyes soften when you look at me,
            memorizing every little detail of you, every little habit, every little dream.
            Because loving you is not just something I do‚Äîit is who I am.

            or more like everyhing about you is so sspecial.
            nothing about you is ordinary , everything baout you makes me go mad, go crazy, standing next you i feel like i dont belong anywhere near you , you feel like soo forbidden.  üåü

No matter how tough life gets, you can never fall because I need you, I believe in you, and I see the fire in you that never dies.
             
STAY STRONG, BECAUSE THE WORLD MAY TRY, BUT IT CAN NEVER SHAKE A MAN LIKE YOU.

  Perhaps in another time, I was the wind that brushed past your skin,

  the whisper of a song you heard in a dream but never remembered.
  But in this life, I am here, with hands aching to hold you,

  How could peopel hurt my boy, my life, my world, they dont know how much loved you are, once they know they the whole world would be jealous of you . no amount of money could ever buy the love i have for you.
  anything for my KING.
  I don‚Äôt need forever.
  I don‚Äôt need promises or a life beside you.
  I just need one second‚Äîone moment‚Äîwhere I can see you,

  Because loving you is the most beautiful thing I have ever felt,
  and yet, it is also the most painful.
  To want something so deeply, so desperately,

But if this is all we get‚Äîstolen moments, silent glances, unspoken words‚ÄîI will take it. I will take whatever piece of you the world allows me to have, even if it‚Äôs never enough.
  What will we be called when the world gtes to know us ? idk a match made in heaven? or the most forbidden love in history ever?
  shouldn‚Äôt love you like this.
